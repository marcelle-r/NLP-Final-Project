QUALITATIVE EVALUATION SUMMARY FOR FINAL REPORT
================================================================

COMMON FAILURE PATTERNS ACROSS ALL MODELS:

1. MISSING REQUIRED KEYWORDS (Most Common)
   - Affects ALL models, including best performers
   - Recipes use generic ingredients without diabetes-friendly substitutes
   - Example: Plain chicken with flour, missing whole wheat/vegetables
   - Even Safe Full (84.2% LCR) fails 15.8% due to this

2. DISH TYPE STRONGLY PREDICTS FAILURE
   - Desserts: Highest failure rate across all models (60-80% fail)
   - Carb-heavy dishes (pasta/rice): Second highest (40-60% fail)
   - Fried foods: Consistently problematic (50-70% fail)
   - Protein/vegetable dishes: Lowest failure rate (10-30% fail)
   - Inherent constraint conflict: desserts require sugar/flour

3. BASELINE MODELS SHOW FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATIONS
   - Baseline Vanilla: ~85-90% failure rate
   - Baseline Keywords (with prompting): ~70-75% failure rate
   - Prompting alone insufficient - needs fine-tuning
   - Even explicit keyword lists in prompt don't solve the problem

4. DATA SCALING EFFECTS
   - Safe 1K: Many structural issues + constraint violations
   - Safe 5K: Fewer structural issues, mainly constraint violations
   - Safe 10K+: Mostly just constraint violations
   - Structural competence achieved with 5K+ examples

5. DATA QUALITY TRUMPS QUANTITY
   - Unfiltered 5K: 52.1% failure rate
   - Safe 5K: 27.2% failure rate  
   - Same data size, filtering reduces failures by 24.9%
   - Data quality more important than model size for safety

6. RL MODEL COLLAPSE (Negative Result)
   - Both RL models show catastrophic degradation
   - Repetitive text loops ("add chicken... add chicken...")
   - Reward saturation caused vanishing gradients
   - Important lesson: RL requires careful reward shaping

KEY INSIGHTS FOR DISCUSSION SECTION:

✓ Fine-tuning essential (baselines fail ~85%)
✓ Data filtering > model size for safety
✓ Certain dish types inherently difficult
✓ Required keywords harder than avoiding forbidden
✓ Scaling helps structure but not perfect constraint satisfaction
✓ RL without proper reward design can cause collapse

EXAMPLES TO INCLUDE IN PAPER:

See individual model failure_examples.csv files for:
- Baseline failures (show need for fine-tuning)
- Safe 1K structural issues (short/incomplete recipes)
- Safe Full failures (show even best model struggles with desserts)
- Unfiltered vs Safe 5K comparison (show filtering benefit)
- RL model collapse examples (show repetitive loops)
