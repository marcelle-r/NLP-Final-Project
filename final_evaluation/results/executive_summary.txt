FINAL EVALUATION SUMMARY
======================================================================

📊 KEY FINDINGS:

1. BEST MODEL: safe_lora
   - Average LCR across all test sets: 95.4%
   - Improvement over baseline: +86.8 percentage points

2. BASELINE PERFORMANCE:
   - Baseline (zero-shot): 8.6% LCR
   - Shows need for fine-tuning on diabetes-safe data

3. GENERALIZATION:
   - Tested on 2 external datasets (RecipeNLG, Kaggle Food Recipes)
   - Plus 108 adversarial prompts (challenging dishes)
   - Total: 708 test examples

4. QUALITY METRICS:
   - BERTScore F1 remains high (~0.80+) across all models
   - Shows constraint satisfaction doesn't harm recipe quality

5. SAFETY-STRATIFIED RESULTS:
   - Models successfully FIX originally-unsafe recipes
   - Demonstrates ability to transform any recipe into diabetes-friendly version
